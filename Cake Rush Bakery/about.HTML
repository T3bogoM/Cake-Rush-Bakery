      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        At Cake Rush Bakery, we believe that every moment is sweeter with something special. We specialise in cupcakes, wedding cakes, and custom orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cake Rush Bakery first opened its doors in 2017, founded by <strong>Nomcebo Biyela</strong>, a young entrepreneur born and raised in the Northern Cape. Inspired by her grandmother’s baking, she turned her passion into a thriving business that quickly gained popularity through social media.
