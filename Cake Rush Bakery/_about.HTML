      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>

      <p>
        Established in <strong>2017</strong> by <em>Nomcebo Biyela</em>, a passionate young entrepreneur from the Northern Cape, 
        Cake Rush Bakery began as a small kitchen dream inspired by her grandmother’s timeless recipes. 
        With dedication, creativity, and the power of social media, the bakery grew into a beloved local favorite. 
        To meet rising demand, Nomcebo expanded her business online — allowing customers to browse, customize, 
        and order their favorite cakes with just a few clicks.
