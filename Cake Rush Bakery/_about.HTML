        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>At Cake Rush Bakery we believe that every moment is sweeter with something sweet. we specialise in cupcakes, wedding cakes and custom orders</p>
        <p>Cake Rush Bakery first opened its doors in 2017, founded by Nomcebo Biyela. A young entrepreneur born and raised in the Northern Cape, she learned her skills from her grandmother. As her passion for baking grew, she wanted to turn it into a business, which later expanded rapidly in a short period, thanks to social media as a key growth tool. She then looked for additional tools to help grow her business, including a website to take orders systematically and deliver the goods</p>
