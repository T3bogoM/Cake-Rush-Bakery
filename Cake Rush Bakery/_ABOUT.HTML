        <h1>About Cake Rush Bakery</h1>
        <p>At Cake Rsuh Bakkery we believe that every moment is sweeter with somthing sweet. we specialise in cupcakes, wedding cakes and custom orders </p>
        <p>Cake Rush Bakery first opened its doors in 2017, founded by Nomcebo Biyela. A young entrepreneur born and raised in the Northern Cape, she learned her skills from her grandmother. As her passion for baking grew, she wanted to turn it into a business, which later expanded rapidly in a short period, thanks to social media as a key growth tool. She then looked for additional tools to help grow her business, including a website to take orders systematically and deliver the goods</p>

        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <p>"I ordered a variety of cakes and pastries for my daughter’s birthday, and I couldn’t be happier with the experience! The vanilla cupcakes were soft and fluffy, the chocolate éclairs were absolutely divine, and the presentation was stunning. Every guest kept asking where the treats came from. This business doesn’t just bake cakes they create memories filled with sweetness and joy. I’ll definitely be ordering again!"
