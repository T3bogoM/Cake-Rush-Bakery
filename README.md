Justification of Design Choices

1. Design & Layout:
   The structure is intuitive and user-friendly, with a logo for recognition, a navigation bar for accessibility, and a consistent header and footer across all pages.

2. Colour Palette:

   * Pink: Evokes warmth, friendliness, and sweetness — ideal for dessert branding.
   * White: Suggests hygiene, freshness, and simplicity.

3. Typography:
   Fonts were selected to balance personality with readability. “Poppins” was chosen for headers (modern and clean), and “Open Sans” for body text (clear and elegant).

Detailed Layout and Navigation

* Header: Contains the bakery logo, slogan, and navigation bar.
* Main Section: Displays page-specific content (home, products, gallery, about, contact).
* Footer: Includes social media links, contact info, and copyright.

Pages:

Home: Hero section, featured products, and quick links 
About Us: Bakery story, mission, and testimonials

Gallery: Clickable images with lightbox view
